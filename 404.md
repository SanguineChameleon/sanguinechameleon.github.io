Hi! I didn't expect you to be reading this.

To be honest, I'm not even sure how you ended up here. This site only has, like, two navigation links. So either you incorrectly copy-pasted a link, or you deliberately decided to look at the 404 page.

Either way, welcome. I don't know what to put here.

Maybe I could hide a code somewhere and send you on a fun treasure hunt. Like an easter egg. But I don't really like mysteries. Not because they're mysterious or anything, but because I'd rather be transparent about the things I make.

If I were to set up a puzzle or ARG or whatever, I'd make sure to include a write-up detailing what I made and why I made it. I don't like the idea of my work existing on its own without explanation. That's partly why I made this website in the first place.

I think I would be a terrible magician.

Then again, sometimes I do make things for no reason at all. Sometimes there's no deeper meaning.

...What was I writing again?

Oh, right. 404 pages. I still don't know what to put in them.

I could've written something standard like _\"The requested page could not be found\"_, but that's not my style.

I don't think I can pull off a \"creative\" 404 page either. And I don't have any jokes that I'd find funny. Any joke about the number 404 itself is lame anyway.

Hmm...

These are words that I am currently typing to pad out the length of this post.

These are some more words. Some more words again. Even more words!

This is becoming oddly existential.

I don't really like what I've written. But I don't know what else I could've written.

Whatever. In a few months, I'll probably forget about this post anyway.

Regardless, thank you for reading this far.
