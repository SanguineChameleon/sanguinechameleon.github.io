title: I Will Solve It
---

So I solve Project Euler problems sequentially. There are a few reasons for that, but I won't get into my whole philosophy here.

One thing it does, though, is it forces me to solve *the current problem*. No skipping ahead if I think it's too hard.

This is a good thing. It forces me to think. It forces me to be uncomfortable. If I only solved problems I found easy, I wouldn't improve.

It's been going well. 750+ solves. All good. Until... *this problem*. I won't say which problem it is, because I don't want to scare anyone away from attempting it.

But... *this problem!* I think(?) I'm so annoyingly close to solving it.

Okay, so maybe I wrote this post just to complain. But I also have another reason.

See, maybe this is just me, but I do genuinely get upset when I can't solve something. Like, not *upset* upset, but pretty close to it. It's like that itch you can't scratch.

It's easy to sink hours obsessing over a problem. That's fine when you have all summer. Not so good when you have responsibilities, and I am definitely not short of those!

So this is a reminder that ~~I should *really* do my homework~~ it's okay to be stuck. Admittedly, I haven't felt stuck like this for a long while, so it's good to be reminded.

I know I really want to complete Project Euler one day, but it can wait. No need to rush.

Surprisingly, the world will not collapse if I *don't* solve it today. Or this week. Or this month. Or this year.

But I know that I can solve it. Will solve it.

Maybe the inspiration comes when I'm in the shower, or when I'm on the bus, or waiting in the elevator. Who knows.

But I know that it's not impossible. It's not a matter of *if* I solve it, but *when* I solve it.

Because I can solve it. I will solve it.

Maybe not today. Not this week. Not this month. Not this year.

But I will solve it.

I will solve it.

I will solve it!

~~*Please* do your homework.~~
