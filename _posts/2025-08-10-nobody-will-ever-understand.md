title: "Nobody Will Ever Understand"

> **Note**: I'm primarily writing this for myself. I'll try not to be too blunt, though I do think a little bluntness is unavoidable when it comes to these kinds of topics. As with all my posts, you are free to agree or disagree with whatever I write.

Here's the thing: Nobody will ever understand.

Nobody will ever understand why I love Project Euler.

Nobody will ever understand the joy I get from solving a hard problem.

Nobody will ever understand why I like standing at the BL section of a bookstore without buying anything.

Nobody will ever understand why I get all happy and giggly over a stupidly fluffy fanfic.

Nobody will ever understand why I don't have other interests.

Nobody will ever understand why I find small talk excruciatingly boring and difficult.

Nobody will ever understand why I am the way I am.

But they can try. Maybe that's good enough.

Here's the other thing, though: I will never understand.

I will never understand why people skip lectures because they're too early.

I will never understand why people study just for the sake of getting good grades.

I will never understand why people dislike mathematics.

I will never understand why people like watching sports.

I will never understand why people choose to pursue romance.

I will never understand why some people are extroverts.

I will never understand why everyone is the way they are.

But I can try. Maybe that's good enough.

Maybe that's all there is to it. We're all just silly little creatures in this silly little universe, trying to understand each other. We can get close, but we can never really get there.

There is no such thing as being weird, because there is no such thing as being normal.

There is no such thing as not fitting in, because there is no such thing as fitting in.

There is no such thing as being misunderstood, because there is no such thing as being understood.

It's a deeply uncomfortable thought for me, but it's one that I should accept.

So with the academic year starting tomorrow (tomorrow? tomorrow!), I can only hope that I'm not too hard on myself.

Thank you for reading all of this, and enjoy the rest of your day.
