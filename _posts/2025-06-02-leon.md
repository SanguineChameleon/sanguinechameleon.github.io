Hi! I'm SanguineChameleon.

This is my website, where I write about whatever I like, whenever I like.

## Personal Details

This section is here for you to decide whether or not I'm qualified to say what I say.

- <span id="age"></span> My pronouns are he/him.
- I'm from Vietnam, but my English is much better than my Vietnamese.
- My real name is almost impossible to pronounce, so I just go by Leo online.
- I'm a <span id="uni-year"></span> Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore.
- I was a gold medalist at [IOI 2023](https://stats.ioinformatics.org/results/2023).

That's about as much info as I'll give here. If you're curious, you can stalk me further. You have my permission. Just don't show up at my house unannounced.

## Why this website?

When I was younger, I had a bad habit of permanently deleting everything I made online. I think I've reached the age where I can confidently share my thoughts and opinions, however silly they may be.

Also, before this website, I didn't have a proper place to write commentary on the things I made or the things I did. I think my writing will be useful, at least for me and my future self, if not anyone else.

However, this won't be a blog where I write about my daily experiences. I find that kind of journaling pretty exhausting to maintain.

Sometimes I will stumble across a stranger's blog, read a few posts, be mildly entertained, and move on. I hope someone out there has that experience with my blog.

## My Interests

Here's a list of my interests, in descending order of relevance.

### Drawing

I recently started learning how to draw! You can check out my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sanguinechameleon/). There's not much there yet, but I'll try to post roughly every day.

I'm still figuring out where I'm headed with this. For now, I've just been using my original character as practice. More details about the little rascal sometime soon!

### Competitive Programming

So, I like competitive programming. I was introduced to Codeforces when I was 10, and you could say that my life has gone downhill ever since.

While I'm still proud of my IOI gold medal, I understand that it's becoming increasingly irrelevant due to AI. Still, I think competitive programming is pretty neat.

### Project Euler

<img onerror='this.style.display = "none"' src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/SanguineChameleon2.png" style="margin-top: 0rem; margin-bottom: 0rem; margin-left: 0; width: 10rem"/>

Project Euler is a series of mathematical and computational problems that can be solved through programming. I like myself a good challenge, and Project Euler has plenty of them. What's not to enjoy?

On October 22, 2025, I completed [all problems]({% post_url 2025-10-22-project-euler-perfection %}) on Project Euler. If you're reading this, either I still have all of them solved, or I'm working on some problem right now.

### YouTube

I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SanguineChameleon) that I sporadically post videos to. I'm not a \"YouTuber\" by any means. I just post things that I make in video form. I upload my music there too.

Most of my videos are decent. A few are questionable. In the end, though, all of them are expressions of myself, and I'm fine with keeping them up online.

I go into more detail about my videos in [this post]({% post_url 2025-06-07-youtube %}).

### Miscellaneous

Lastly, some things that don't warrant an entire section:

- **AO3**: Sometimes I might read (and [write](https://archiveofourown.org/users/SanguineChameleon)) on AO3, especially romantic slash fiction. What can I say? I like seeing people be happy.

- **Music**: My music taste is horrible and non-existent. I don't have a Spotify account or anything like that. I just listen to songs on YouTube. I don't really have favorite artists, but I listen to a lot of Vocaloid/SynthV/UTAU songs. I also like listening to music that you'd find in rhythm games. And speaking of rhythm games...

- **Rhythm games**: Sometimes I play rhythm games at the nearest arcade. I used to be obsessed with Pump It Up, but now I just go whenever. I also play Taiko no Tatsujin and maimai.

## Contact Me

Despite having a decent presence online, I'm a bit fussy about personal contact.

Assuming we don't already know each other, I'm on Discord at `@sanguinechameleon`.

Otherwise, please do <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> contact me anywhere else, including (but not limited to):

- **Content platforms** (e.g. YouTube, Instagram)

  You can comment on my stuff, but please don't reach out to me there.

- **Problem-solving platforms** (e.g. Codeforces)

  Please don't ask me for help. I can't offer much besides generic advice, sorry.
- **Social media platforms** (e.g. Twitter)

  I don't like social media at all. I only have accounts to view content.

- **"Professional" platforms** (e.g. LinkedIn)

  Eww. No. Gross. Never do this. Stop.

## Feedback

Feel free to leave feedback on my work, constructive or otherwise.

Please note that I most likely won't respond, and occasionally I may remove comments. This is a personal decision that I hope you can respect.

I promise you that I read everything and I truly appreciate it! ❤️

This website was made possible with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). While both tools made things a lot easier, this was still my first experience with front-end development, and I'm satisfied with what I've made.
