Now for something a bit different.

This is a fictional work I wrote about a month ago, titled *In Sickness*. After some tweaking, it now has its own little space here on my website. It also feels fitting to share now, since I'm actually sick. Nothing too bad, just a slight cold.

I find it difficult to write in the third person, so this work is entirely dialogue-based. The characters and setting are intentionally ambiguous. That's the magic of fiction.

If it isn't clear, each section takes place in a different time frame, with smaller blocks of dialogue indicating short pauses in time. Also, lines are color-coded and begin with different symbols depending on who's speaking. I'm not sure why I'm dissecting my work like this, but, you know, formatting is hard.

Usually, with anything I make, I'd have some behind-the-scenes commentary. But I'm very bad at literary analysis, so I won't be attempting that. I just wrote what I wrote because I liked it. Can't really explain further.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this work as much as I enjoyed writing it. That is to say, a reasonable amount.

~ You sure you don't wanna come to the party?

> No I'm not.

~ When's the last time you went outside?

> This morning, actually, I had a lecture-

~ Doesn't count. Come on, we're going.

> Alright, alright. Why do I always get dragged along with you?

> Eugh.

~ But I'm so lonely... I miss you.

> Really now.

~ I miss you, my handsome, pretty boy.

```dialogue
> I can't believe I ruined our anniversary.

~ Hey now, it's not your fault. It's my fault for picking the stupid place.

> But it's my fault for eating seafood.

~ But I recommended it to you.
 
> Maybe it's actually the restaurant's fault.

~ Mmm, yeah. Anyone who dares make my boyfriend sick deserves to-

> Gonna stop you right there. The worst you should do is leave a bad review.

~ No grand conspiracies? No assassination plans?

> You've been watching too many spy movies. I'm picking a rom-com next time.

~ You're no fun.

> As always.

> Anyway, my stomach is undoubtedly empty now. Wanna grab some actual food?

~ Burgers?

> Burgers.

```dialogue
~ Oh my god, you're here. You're here.

> Yep, I'm right here- Woah, don't hug me too tight, it kinda hurts.

~ Sorry, sorry. I'm just glad you're okay.

> Did you run from your workplace? You're sweating.

~ Of course I did! Why wouldn't I?

> You didn't have to. They should've told you I was fine-

~ How long ago was the surgery?

> A few hours ago.

~ A few hours? They couldn't have told me earlier?

> Hey, hey, deep breaths for me, alright?

~ I'm just, it's just...

> Shh, you're here now, and I'm here too. I'm not leaving you anytime soon.

~ ...

~ You're such an idiot.

> I know. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful next time. I promise.

~ You promise?

> I promise.

> You should get changed. That suit looks so uncomfortable.

~ Yeah... yeah, it is.
```

```dialogue
> Are you sure they'll let you stay overnight?

~ Yeah, I just told them I was your husband. They don't check that info.

> Huh. Didn't expect you to be so bold.

~ Do you not wanna get married?

> No no, I'd love to get married one day. I just...

~ Ah. No, I get it. We don't have to talk about it right now. It's okay.

> Hmm, nope. You're my husband now. You will have the great honor of...

~ Of?

> Carrying me to the bathroom. Gotta throw up.

~ Seriously?

> Yup.

~ That was the least romantic thing you've said since I've known you.

> The least romantic thing I've said so far.

~ Ugh, I'll hold you up. Don't move your head too quickly.

> Anything, my prince.

~ Never call me that again.
```

```dialogue
~ Seriously though, do you really want to get married?

> Yeah, of course. Who do you think will propose first?

~ It's not a race.

> Oh, it is now.

```dialogue
> Worst. Wedding. Ever. Oh my god.

~ My stomach is burning.

> I feel like I'm being punched in the guts repeatedly.

~ Why did you suggest seafood for the main course?

> Why did you agree with it?

~ Because it's a fancy occasion and the guests would like it!

> I agree! But we clearly don't!

~ God, I hate everything!

> Including me?

~ Yes! I am really not in the mood for-

> Okay, okay, I know. Sorry. We're gonna be fine.

~ We're gonna be fine.

> Always. I gotta throw up again.
```

```dialogue
> Whew, that was... an experience.

~ You alright?

> Yep. You?

~ All good now. Let's get out of here. We've worried everyone enough.

~ Right?
