I'm back with another story! This one's about two college boys named Vincent and... well, you'll just have to read it to find out the other one's name!

They're so cute and so them. I want to put them in a blender (affectionately).

This is by far the longest thing I've written (almost 7k words!!). I started it in early September, and I finally pushed through to finish it today.

You can find more author's notes at the end of the story, if I get around to writing them.

Right now, it's midnight, and I deserve a waffle. With maple syrup.

<p style="margin-bottom:2.5rem">Anyway, I hope you enjoy our two boys in <em>Unreadable</em>!</p>

So, I can read minds.

It's honestly kind of a lame story. I was in 7th grade, and we were having a soccer game against our rival school. Some idiot from the other team smacked me right in the head.

I told my friends at first. But then I quickly realized that people freak out when you tell them you can read their minds. So I've learned to keep it to myself.

I can control when I want to read someone's mind. It's not just a constant stream of consciousness. I try to use it only when I need to. Helped me avoid a lot of red flags.

I'm a college sophomore now, and I haven't told anyone since. Not even close friends.

Anyway, life goes on. I need to get ready for that linguistics class.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

Like always, every school year starts with me being absurdly early.

I keep thinking it takes an hour to get to campus, when it only takes half as long.

I should enjoy it while it lasts. Who knows how late I'll be as time goes on.

As I get off the bus, I notice someone staring at the campus map. He seems confused.

Not a familiar face. Guess he must be a freshman.

I take a glance at my watch. Sure, I've got time. Might as well try to socialize.

Besides, he's kind of cute.

"Hey, need some help getting to class?"

"Oh! Yeah, sorry, do you know where Lecture Hall 29 is?"

"Linguistics 101?"

"Oh, are you taking it too?"

"Yep, I'm heading there as well. Here, I'll show you the way."

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

"So, you're a freshman, right? Linguistics major?"

"Yeah. And you?"

"Oh, no, I'm actually a sophomore. I'm taking this as an elective."

"I see, I see. So, why linguistics then?"

"I guess I could ask you the same thing. Why linguistics for you?"

He thinks about it for a while.

"Well, I guess I just find it interesting."

"There's your answer."

He lets out a small laugh. It sounds nice.

We continue our way to the lecture hall. There are very few people around at this hour. One of the rare benefits of a morning class.

I feel like I'm forgetting something, though.

Oh, right. Idiot.

"I just realized I haven't introduced myself. I'm Vincent, by the way."

"Oliver. Nice to meet you, Vinny!"

Vinny? That's a new one.

"Vinny, huh?"

"Yep, that's your nickname now. Do you like it?"

"Hmm, no, not at all."

"That's too bad then, Vinny."

Man, I'm already getting flustered. I've only talked to him for like, what, 10 minutes?

This is not good.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

Class is starting soon.

I don't usually sit near the front, but Oliver insisted.

He also insisted we sit next to each other, which I am perfectly normal about.

...He's gay, right? I'm not just wasting my time?

Meh, what am I talking about? He's totally been flirting with me.

Right?

Would it be okay if I just checked? Would I be intruding? Do I really want to--

Oliver drops his pen.

"Ah!"

Well, that settles it then. Sorry Oliver. Your noises are too cute.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

...

Huh?

...

What?

No, no, no, surely not.

He's literally sitting next to me. There's no way.

I impulsively read the girl behind us.

<p class="thought">"Ugh, I should've had breakfast before coming here. I'm starving."</p>

Okay, okay, I haven't lost it yet. I really shouldn't have done that.

I stare back at Oliver.

Nothing.

Oh no.

Oh, no, no, no. This has never happened to me.

Is he seriously that airheaded?

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

Vinny is looking at me funny.

"Hello? Vinny? You there?"

"Huh? O-oh, right, sorry, Oliver. Kinda spaced out there. I guess I'm a bit tired."

That gives me an idea.

"Yeah, I'm tired too. Morning lectures suck."

"Right?"

I yawn as dramatically as possible.

"Actually, do you have anything after this? We can go get coffee later."

"Oh, uh, no I don't. My next class is at 12."

"Perfect, I know just the place we can go to."

Fantastic work, Ollie.

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

"Good morning. I'm Professor Fletcher, and I'll be your lecturer for Linguistics 101."

Wow, that sure is a monotone voice.

I whisper to Vinny.

"Are all the professors like this?"

"Hmm? Oh, you mean his voice? Not all of them. You're just unlucky."

"Vinny, I'm already starting to regret this major..."

"Hey now, the really smart ones are always like this, if it helps."

"It doesn't."

Out of boredom, I decide to listen in.

<p class="thought">"I am not paid enough to get up this early."</p>

I stifle a giggle. I guess he's human after all.

"What's so funny?" Vinny asks.

"Eh? Uh, nothing! Nothing. Just remembered a funny cat video. I'll show you later."

He raises an eyebrow, but says nothing about it.

That was a close one. I need to be more careful next time.

It's Vinny's fault for being so attractive!

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

See, I can read people's minds.

Long story short, I hit my head really hard when I was a kid.

Is it a cool ability? Obviously.

Have I told anyone? Of course not.

It's my secret, and everyone is none the wiser. Mwahaha.

On a serious note, I don't want to think about what'll happen if I get found out. 

They might perform all sorts of experiments on me.

Though, I've done some experiments myself.

I have a long list of things I can and can't do with this power.

For example, it doesn't work underwater.

I honestly don't remember how I tested that.

But anyway, I'm getting distracted. I should focus on the lecture.

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

"My vanilla latte, and your black coffee. Here you go."

"Thanks, Oliver."

"Please, no need to be so formal. Just call me Ollie!"

"Never."

We get seated and enjoy our coffee.

Though, I'm not sure if Vinny is even remotely enjoying his.

How do people even drink that?

"You sure you don't need any sugar? I can go grab a packet."

"I already told you, I don't like it sweet."

"Liar. Everyone likes it sweet."

"I guess I'm the exception, then. That's too bad."

Vinny is impossible.

I wonder what he's thinking about right now.

Hopefully about me.

You know what, sure, why not? I'm curious. Just a peek.

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

...

Eh? I can't hear anything.

I take a sip of my latte. Let me try again.

...

Nope, still nothing.

That's weird.

I run through my mental checklist.

Does it work if I'm tired? Yeah, it should.

Does it work if they're facing me? Yeah, the signal's even stronger like that.

Does it work if they're cute? Don't see why that would matter.

Does it work if they're a love interest? Yep. Learned that the hard way in high school.

So I guess there's something about Vinny.

Intriguing.

I need to update my list then. "Doesn't work on Vinny".

Yeah, that'd be a funny entry.

"Now you're the one staring at me, Oliver."

"Oh, uh--"

"Seems we both have a thing for staring at each other, huh?"

Gah! You!

I time my attack just as Vinny takes his next sip.

"It's because I was lost in your eyes~"

He immediately chokes on his coffee.

Mission accomplished.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

It's become a routine.

Tuesday morning. Meet Oliver outside the lecture hall. Grab coffee afterwards.

Get embarrassed by all the flirting. He's definitely doing it on purpose.

I wouldn't have it any other way.

Well, not entirely. There are still two things at the back of my mind.

First off: Oliver stares.

I mentioned it a few times, but I've stopped bringing it up.

Maybe that's just what he does.

But I feel like there's more to it.

Which leads me to the second thing: Oliver is still elusive.

No matter how much I try, he remains impossible to read.

I shouldn't be trying to read him in the first place.

But some part of me is dying to know.

Is there something you aren't telling me, Oliver?

Whatever, I'm probably overthinking all of this. I should enjoy what I have right now.

We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

Speaking of bridges to cross...

"Dude, Vince, you still haven't asked him out properly?"

"Shh! Jack, not here! We're in public!"

"Okay, okay, sorry!"

Jack leans in closely. Somehow, this feels worse.

"...you still haven't asked him out properly? Is that better?"

"Sort of. No, I haven't."

"Really? Why?"

"I don't know, okay? Maybe I'm misunderstanding all of this."

"My man, that's a lie and we both know it."

"Okay, fine. He's totally been flirting with me. Happy?"

"No. I need you to ask him out right now, Vince."

"Easy for you to say! Remember that whole ordeal between you and Marcus?"

"I, uh--"

"Exactly, Jack. Not so fun to be on the receiving end, is it?"

"Alright, I get it! For the last time, thank you for getting us together, okay?"

"You're welcome as always. I'm the better wingman and you know it."

Jack shoots back. "The better wingman can't get himself a date? Hmm?"

He has a horrible, smug grin on his face.

I resist the urge to punch him.

"Ugh, you are the worst! I'll ask him out after midterms. Deal?"

"Deal."

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

There are a few things I like about college life so far.

First is all the friends I've made. I'm glad the people here are fun.

By fun, I mean the parties, of course. The vibes are unforgettable.

Too bad I can't drink. Wouldn't want to risk exposing my secret.

I'm not just a party animal, though! I like the courses too. They're really interesting.

I also love the food here. Much better than whatever they were serving in high school.

But above all else, there's Vinny.

Vinny, Vinny, Vinny.

Vinny, you're a real mystery, you know?

I wish I knew what was going on in your mind.

I've tried. A lot.

Vinny mentioned the staring one or two times, but I've been more cautious about it.

He hasn't noticed a thing.

Maybe there really is something about Vinny. Who knows.

All I know is that I'm getting tired of flirting with you, Vinny.

My friends were surprised we weren't dating, given how much I gush about you.

I really want to go out with you, you know?

But I can't. Not until I know how to read you.

It's not like I don't trust you or anything, but I just want to be sure.

I've been hurt before, and I don't want it to happen again.

So, Vinny, I hope you don't mind staying flustered for now.

I'll figure it out soon. Just you wait~

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

Midterms are finally over. Life is good.

It also means my weekly dose of Vinny is back! Life is great.

"Vinny! Long time no see!"

"Hey, Oliver. It's only been two weeks."

"But it felt like forever. I missed you."

A sly grin appears on Vinny's face.

"That much? If that felt like forever for you, wait until you experience finals."

"Mmph. You're such a killjoy, Vinny."

"Of course. Should we head inside the lecture hall?"

"Sure."

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

As usual, we head to the café after class for some much-needed caffeine.

Although, I feel like something's off.

Vinny seems awfully confident today.

He's had this smirk ever since we walked in.

I should try teasing him.

"You know, you made fun of me for missing you, but you look pretty happy to see me."

"Hmm? Oh, I was thinking about you, actually."

"About me?"

"Yeah. We've been friends for a while now, and I wanted to ask you something."

"And what would that be?"

I stare at him, expecting a response.

But Vinny doesn't answer. Instead, he reaches for his bag.

What is he up to now?

He pulls out a pen and paper and starts writing.

Then, without a word, he slides the note across the table.

Ah.

<p class="note">"Dinner with me sometime?"</p>

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

My smile falters for a split second.

Shoot. I hope he didn't notice that.

I didn't want things to be like this, Vinny! Not yet!

Should I say yes?

I'm not so sure.

But if I said no, I probably won't get another chance.

So who am I to turn you down?

I suck it up and reply with the snarkiest possible response.

"Is this your elaborate way of asking me out?"

"Maybe."

"Well, consider yourself lucky then. Are you free this Saturday?"

"Sounds good to me. See you then, Oliver."

"You too, Vinny."

I don't know what I've gotten myself into.

Why do you have to make this so hard, Vinny?

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

"I did it Jack! I asked him out! He said yes!"

"My man, Vince! Let's go!"

"Let's go! I'm a beast! I'm unstoppable! Rahhh!"

"You're not gonna be single anymore!"

"Wooo!"

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

Well, today's the day.

Vinny told me to meet him at the park on campus.

I'm not entirely sure what to expect.

I'm a bit nervous.

Eh, who am I kidding? You got this, Ollie! Of course you do. Definitely.

Now where is that man...

Ah! There he is.

"Vinny! Over here!" I wave my hands as wildly as I can.

I see his familiar smile as he walks towards me.

"Evening, Oliver. You look wonderful."

"And you look handsome as always, Vinny."

He laughs softly.

Oooh, is that a blush? I'll remember this moment.

"So, where to, Vinny?"

"Well, there's a really nice burger place nearby--"

B-burger?

"Woah woah woah, stop there."

"What? You don't like burgers?"

"No no, I do, but... really Vinny? Burgers? On our first date?"

"It's not like this is the first time I'm meeting you."

I feign immense shock.

"Oh, Vinny, you break my heart! First you ask me out, and then you treat me like this!"

"Egh, stop overreacting. I know you're gonna like those burgers."

"And if I don't?"

"Then I'll pay for you."

I pretend to be even more shocked.

"Vinny! You weren't even gonna pay for me? How could you?"

He rolls his eyes. "You cannot be serious, Oliver."

I giggle at the sight. "I'm kidding, I'm kidding! Come on, let's go."

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

"Okay, fine, it kind of tastes alright."

"Told you you'd love it, Oliver."

"No I don't."

"Yes you do. I saw your eyes light up when we got our food."

"Whatever. You win this time."

I grudgingly take another bite of my burger in defeat. It tastes so good.

We eat our meals quietly together until Vinny breaks the silence.

"Sooo... how were midterms?"

"Nerd," I respond with no hesitation.

Vinny gives me a look of annoyance.

"Sorry for trying to make conversation, I guess."

"I did well, Vinny! Stop looking at me like that."

His cold exterior crumbles with a smile.

"Alright, that's good to know. I did well too."

"Okay, but Vinny, I might've lost some points on stupid questions."

"Hmm?" He looks at me curiously.

"I don't know, I feel like some of the questions were so subjective."

"Ah, yeah," Vinny nods. "Happens. Don't worry, it's usually not worth much."

"It's like the professors want me to read their minds or something!"

Vinny tenses up for just a moment before relaxing again.

"Oh, heh, yeah, I get it!"

Did I really see that?

Eh, I was probably imagining things.

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

"By the way, you should bring Lily next time, Oliver."

"Oh? You like her?"

"I love her. I love all cats, actually. Your photos don't do her justice."

"Really? But you told me you didn't have any pets."

"Well, my roommate is allergic to cats. It's a tragedy."

"Wow, your roommate sucks."

"Nah, he's a cool guy. You guys should meet sometime. You'll like him."

"Oh, which reminds me Vinny, you should join my study group! Have a little study date?"

Vinny looks skeptical. "Are you sure there will be studying if I come?"

"Yeah? What else?" I ask, confused.

"Endless flirting."

I try not to die of embarrassment.

"Vinny! I don't flirt with you all the time, okay?"

He grins deviously. "Sounding real believable there, Oliver."

Ugh, Vinny! Stop flustering me like this!

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

We went back to the park after dinner.

Vinny's skipping rocks across the lake.

"I never knew you could do this, Vinny."

"Oh, I learned it when I was a kid. It's relaxing."

"Mmhm. It sure is."

We stand there in silence, with only the soft sound of rocks hitting the water.

Splash. Splash. Splash.

Then it stops. Vinny turns and looks at me.

"Say, Oliver, have you ever had a close connection to someone?"

"And why do you ask?" I respond, hesitantly.

"I don't know. I just... feel like we have something special."

I'm not sure how to respond to that.

So we continue looking at each other.

"Oliver, there's something I've been meaning to tell you."

He looks unsure.

"Yeah? What is it, Vincent?"

He looks down for a while, and then returns to me with a half-smile.

"...Never mind. It's a secret. Maybe some other time."

I put the dramatics back on.

"Oh, Vinny! You can't just leave me hanging like that!"

"Hey now, this is only our first date. I gotta keep up the mystery."

"Hmph, you're no fun at all!"

Vinny laughs, and all the tension between us melts away.

Whether we wanted it to or not.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

Idiot.

Idiot, idiot, idiot.

Why did I say any of that?

Now Oliver's gonna think I'm a weirdo.

This sucks. Today sucked.

And I forgot my keys at home.

My life sucks.

I make my way to the front porch and knock.

He'd better still be awake.

The door swings open. "Hey hey, Vince! How was it, lucky man?"

"Terrible. I don't wanna talk about it, Jack. I'm going to bed."

Jack's mood drops. I immediately feel guilty.

Ugh, I really gotta stop doing this. He didn't deserve that.

"Woah, hey, was it really that bad?" He asks, worried.

"No no, I just--"

"Did he stand you up? Oh my god, I'm gonna beat his--"

"No, Jack! Please don't beat up Oliver."

"Oh."

We stare at each other awkwardly.

"So, I'm guessing it was your fault then?"

"Yes, alright? I--"

How do I phrase this?

"I got vulnerable with him, and then I chickened out."

Jack gives me a look of understanding.

"Oh, Vince, I'm sure it wasn't that bad."

"You say that, but..."

"No, really. He probably appreciates it."

I take a deep breath and sigh.

"Jack, how often do you and Marcus actually talk? Like, really talk?"

He pauses before answering.

"Oh, not that often. It's not exactly something you can schedule, you know?"

I can't help but snort at his dumb joke.

"But seriously, between the silly dates and, uh, whatever you two have going on..."

I cringe internally.

"...it's important that you actually talk. About how you feel."

"How I feel?"

"Yeah. Let Oliver see who you really are, okay?"

Who I really am?

The guy who can secretly read minds?

And the one he's into is somehow the only person he can't read?

How on earth would Oliver ever understand any of that?

Why did I even try to tell him the truth?

Maybe it's best he doesn't know.

Maybe we could just have a normal relationship.

Could we?

"Hey, no spiraling after 10 PM," Jack interrupts my train of thought.

"S-sorry, sorry. It's been a long day."

"I know. There's some pizza in the fridge if you want."

I stare at him incredulously.

"You really think he was gonna stand me up?"

"Hey man, you never know. Besides, I was hungry."

"Whatever you say, Jack."

I'm about to head to my room when Jack's face brightens.

"Oh, Vince, wanna play Smash? One quick game before bed."

"To celebrate my failure of a date, huh?"

"Come on, don't be such a buzzkill. You wanna play or not?"

Actually, I should probably take my mind off things for a while.

"Sure. Loser does the dishes or something."

"Hell yeah! Bros before... other bros!"

That gets a genuine laugh out of me.

Never change, Jack.

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

<p class="when">1 month later</p>

"For the last time, Oliver, you can't bring him to our study group."

"Oh come on, Melissa, please?"

She sighs deeply.

"Look, I'm happy for both of you, but he isn't welcome here. Got it?"

My heart breaks a little more.

"Whyyy? Why are you guys so lame?"

"I mean, the man said it himself..." Noah speaks up.

"...you two would just get all lovey-dovey and distract all of us."

"Noah!" I cry out. "You're supposed to be on my side! Why are you agreeing with her?"

"I'm just stating the truth, that's all."

I grumble loudly. "You guys are the worst."

"We love you too," Melissa replies.

Then Taylor starts talking. Uh oh.

"Honestly though, I kinda wanna see them kissing--"

"Taylor!" the three of us yelp.

"What? I wanna see," they shrug, nonchalantly.

My face is almost bright red at this point.

"W-we haven't kissed, alright?"

The whole group falls silent.

"You haven't?" Melissa is the first to speak up.

"Yeah?"

They all keep staring at me in disbelief.

"Didn't you have your first date ages ago?" Noah asks.

"Yeah, but..."

I want to curl up and disappear.

"We haven't been on a date since."

All of them gasp.

"What?!"

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

<p class="when">1 month ago</p>

"Hey, Vinny!" I wave at him.

"Morning, Oliver. You ready for class?"

"Yep! Thanks for last Saturday, by the way. I really enjoyed our date."

"Oh, uh, yeah, of course." Vinny puts his hand behind his head.

"So, coffee later as usual, right?"

Vinny stares off.

I've seen that look before.

He looks like he wants to say something.

"Oh... no. Not today. I have a group project meeting. I'm really sorry, Oliver."

I try to lighten the mood.

"Ah, then just ditch them! I'm cooler than whatever project you have."

Vinny attempts to smirk.

"Can't do that, unfortunately. They'd kill me if I tried."

"Aww."

There's a lingering tension in the air.

So many things left unsaid.

So many things I could say.

So many things I could ask.

But I can't bring myself to.

"Should we head to the hall?" Vinny asks.

"Yeah," I respond flatly.

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

"...and we still go to the same café after class and we still make the same jokes, but something feels off and we both know it, and I feel like it's my fault even though I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything, and I hate that he's not telling me what's wrong--"

"Oliver, Oliver. You're rambling," Noah interrupts.

"Sorry, sorry. You know how I am when I'm..."

"...obsessed with your dense boyfriend?" Melissa teases.

"He's not my boyfriend," I deny instantly.

They all groan in unison.

Melissa rolls her eyes. "Oliver, just talk to him. Ask what's been bothering him."

"Easy for you to say!"

"Yeah, and it's also easy for you to do," Noah quips.

"And I'm supposed to pretend like the past month didn't happen?"

"It's your fault for taking this long," Taylor mumbles quietly.

"Gah, shut up, Taylor." I sink further into my chair.

"Seriously, what's the worst that could happen?" they ask.

"I don't know. He stops talking to me? He breaks things off? I get all sad and depressed? I never get over him? I never find someone else? I die alone?"

"Relax man, plenty of fish in the sea," Noah says, ignoring all of my concerns.

I let out a growl like a... actually, I don't even know what that was.

"Would revising Gricean maxims clear your mind for a bit?" Melissa offers.

"Please just end my misery."

"I think that's maxim of relation," Noah deadpans.

This is the worst day of my life.

---

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

Somehow, we managed to have an (unusually) productive study session.

It felt like an eternity, but we were finally done.

Good. I don't wanna deal with today anymore. I just wanna go home and pet Lily.

"Okay guys, today was fun, I have to go now, I'll see all of you next Thursday, bye-- ah!"

Taylor grabs my arm before I can escape.

"Taylor, let go. Please. I have... stuff to do."

I look at the other two desperately. They both seem to encourage this.

Traitors.

Taylor looks me in the eyes.

"Listen, Oliver, I know this is hard for you, but please talk to him soon."

"But--"

"I get it, finals are soon and everyone is stressing out, but trust me on this, yeah?"

"Fine."

I stare down at the notebooks scattered across the table.

"Do you think it'll work out?"

All of them pipe up.

"Yeah." "Of course." "Obviously."

Really now.

For the first time in a while, I decide to listen in on them.

I deserve it.

Not really.

<p class="thought">"I hope it works out for you."</p>

Aww, thanks, Melissa!

<p class="thought">"Dude, you have no idea how good you have it."</p>

Thank you too, Noah. I guess.

<p class="thought">"Just make out already, oh my god–"</p>

O-oh!

I feel my face heating up again.

"Okay, okay, I get it! I'll talk to him next class."

"Yay!" the three of them chant.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

I keep digging a deeper hole for myself, don't I?

First it was the date. Then I lied about that stupid project.

Now we're stuck in this stalemate. Both of us too afraid to say anything.

Why did I have to go and ruin all of this?

This is my fault.

I wish I hadn't said anything that night.

I wish I never had this ability.

And I really wish Jack would stop being such a pain in the--

"What do you mean you haven't kissed him?"

I quickly place my hand over his mouth. "Jack, you seriously need to stop doing this."

He shoves my hand away.

"No no no, I don't believe you. What do you two even do on your dates then?"

Oh. Oh no.

I hiss through my teeth.

There's no way out of this, huh?

I guess I have to come clean.

Ugh.

"Yeah, uh, about that... we haven't had a second date."

Jack drops his croissant.

"You what?!"

He springs out of his chair like he's about to punch someone.

Probably me.

"Woah, Jack! No!" I put my arms on his shoulders.

"What the hell have you been doing all this time?" Jack demands.

"I don't know, okay? I've been awkward about it, he's been awkward about it, I don't want to say anything because I'm worried I'll hurt him, or I'll get hurt myself. I know I'm a terrible person, alright?"

"Is that why you haven't been talking to me about this? It's been a month, dude!"

"I know! Stop making it such a big deal."

"It is a big deal!"

Jack presses his hands to his temples. Looks like a headache is forming.

Good.

"Brother, you are fumbling so hard. Oh my god."

"What am I supposed to do then?"

"Oh, I don't know, talk to him? Like a decent human being?"

I look down at my plate. That cinnamon roll suddenly looks really appetizing.

"Look," Jack starts again, exasperated. "Is it him or is it you?"

I sigh. "It's me."

Jack glares at me with zero sympathy. "What is your problem, man?"

I briefly consider revealing my secret out of spite.

<p class="thought">"Oh, it's nothing, Jack. I can just read minds. I'm sure he'd totally be fine with that."</p>

Instead, I admit, "I'm worried he won't like me anymore if I opened up to him."

"So you'd rather pretend all this is normal?"

"Honestly? Yeah, probably."

"Selfish jerk," Jack mutters under his breath.

"I heard that!"

Although... I guess he's right. Unfortunately.

This is not good for either of us.

I need to tell him. It's for the best.

Worst-case scenario, Oliver stops talking to me.

Maybe he slaps me and runs away.

No, he's too soft for that.

Okay, that's probably not the worst-case scenario.

Maybe Oliver reports me to the cops. Maybe.

He wouldn't do that.

Right?

Agh, I'm overthinking this. I should just man up.

"You know what? Fine. I'll talk to him properly after finals--"

"No! Next class. I'm begging you, Vince." Jack looks like he might actually cry.

"Whatever. Next class it is."

It's Tuesday.

I'm really not looking forward to this.

I'll try to act normal in class. I can bring it up later at the café.

Although, should we really talk there?

I don't want us to start yelling in public.

Why do I even think we'll fight?

Why can't I stop worrying?

Egh, I'm such a mess right now--

"Hey, Vinny."

"Ah! Oh. Hey, Oliver. You startled me there."

"Sorry, sorry. Should we go to class?"

"Yeah, sure."

Oliver looks... nervous? Why is he nervous? That's not like him at all.

Maybe I shouldn't go through with my plan. Maybe some other time.

No. Stop. No more thinking. Just go to class and focus on the lecture.

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

We're at the café.

Oliver is fidgeting with his straw. I'm staring blankly at my coffee.

Neither of us has said anything since we left the hall.

I hate it.

I need to do something about this.

So I take a deep breath.

"We need to talk," both of us say at the same time.

Huh? What?

"O-oh, sorry," Oliver quickly retreats. "You first."

"Uh, okay," I respond awkwardly. Idiot.

Where do I even start?

"Listen, Oliver, I know I've been acting off lately, and, well, I guess so have you..."

I did not need to say that.

"...but I just want you to know that it's not your fault. At all. It's me."

Oliver deflates. He looks even more upset.

Why is he...

Oh. Oh!

"We're not breaking up! Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I phrased it like that."

Oliver sighs in relief. "Vincent, you really scared me there. Seriously."

"Sorry. I'm bad at talking sometimes."

"So am I," Oliver grins, softly.

I continue. "I'm just worried about things. About opening up."

He nods in silent acknowledgement.

"So, could we talk later this evening? After we're done with classes?"

Oliver thinks for a while.

"Can we go to the lake? It seems appropriate."

"That works. Meet me at 7 PM. Eat dinner before you get there."

I can see Oliver about to protest. Typical.

So I quickly add, "There's an ice cream shop nearby. We can go there after."

"Alright."

"For now," I ask, "is it okay if we just enjoy our coffee together?"

"Yeah. The foam on my latte is melting."

"That's why black coffee is objectively better."

"Whatever you say, old, bitter man."

"I am literally 5 months older than you."

Splash. Splash. Splash.

The rocks hit the water at a steady rhythm.

He should be arriving soon.

Splash. Splash. Splash.

I hear footsteps nearby.

It's him.

"Hey, Oliver."

"Hi. I hope I didn't make you wait too long?"

"No, not at all. I just got here."

I throw my last rock into the lake.

Splash.

"There's a bench over there. Wanna go?" I ask.

"Sure."

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

"You know, Oliver, I've been starstruck from the day I met you."

Oliver gives a small smile. "That bad, huh?"

"Yeah. All the constant flirting didn't help, either."

He lets out a light giggle.

It's the first time I've seen him genuinely happy in a while.

I want to cherish it.

"You really do mean a lot to me, Oliver..."

My chest tightens.

I can see him getting nervous too.

"...and that's why I got scared. I didn't know how to tell you everything. I've never felt anything like this before."

I rest my hand on the bench between us.

"You're truly one of a kind, Oliver."

He gently places his hand on mine.

"I feel the same way, Vincent."

Oliver glances at the lake, then back at me.

"There's something mysterious about you. So many things I want to know. So many things I haven't told you..."

We lean closer to each other without even realizing it.

All the tension from the past month feels so small now.

In this moment, it's just me and Oliver. Here. Together.

Is this really happening?

...

Oliver finally asks what I've been waiting for.

"Vincent... can I kiss you?"

"...Yeah."

And so we kiss.

Fireworks ignite in my head.

I think about how lucky I am to have met Oliver.

<p class="thought">"I don't want to let go. I want this to last forever. Nothing could ever ruin–"</p>

<p class="thought">"Mmm, he tastes like chicken."</p>

I immediately pull away.

Oliver jerks back at the same time. He almost falls off the bench.

...What?

---

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

We stare at each other, dumbfounded, for a good 5 minutes.

All my thoughts are scrambled. Oliver's face has turned white.

I heard him.

As much as I want to deny it, I definitely heard him.

Did he... hear me as well?

There's no way, right?

But then he wouldn't be acting like this.

Just what on earth is going on?

Oliver tries to speak, but no words come out.

He looks mortified, hurt, and guilty all at once.

I hate seeing him like this.

But then a small spark flickers in my mind.

That look... where have I seen it before?

And that's when it all clicks.

No way.

No. No way.

My heart is pounding.

I steel myself before I ask.

"Oliver, did you go to Redwood Middle School?"

He seems thrown off by the question.

"Uh, yeah?" He replies, confused.

Then, his eyes widen in realization.

"Vincent, did you go to Hamilton?"

"Yeah."

All the pieces fall into place.

Oliver...

He looks like he's about to ask another question.

I wait patiently.

"Vincent... did I run into you at that soccer game?"

"...Yes."

A maniacal smile spreads across his face.

Both of us are going crazy.

"Oliver," I whisper, desperately, "can I kiss you again?"

"Sure."

Our lips crash into each other.

My body turns weightless.

All I can think about is Oliver.

I've finally found him.

<p class="thought">"And just so you know, you taste like cheese, Oliver."</p>

<p class="thought">"Shut up."</p>

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

"My cookies and cream, and your vanilla."

"Thanks, Vinny."

"I have to ask though, just vanilla?"

"What? I like vanilla."

"I was expecting The Flamboyant Oliver to like something a bit more adventurous."

"Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you then." He sticks his tongue out.

Agh.

We return to the bench and indulge in our ice cream.

I have a lot of questions, and he probably does too.

I guess I should start.

"Sooo... when did you find out?"

"Oh, just right after the game."

"Really? It took a week until I realized."

"You didn't get curious about all the middle school gossip?"

"...No?"

Oliver looks at me like I'm some sort of alien.

"I don't know, I didn't wanna get caught up in any drama."

"Lame," he responds helpfully.

"Yeah, well, I wasn't really the popular kid at school. Unlike you."

"I wasn't either!"

"Oh, you totally were. I'm imagining it already."

"Mmph," Oliver admits defeat.

"Anyway," I continue, "did you tell anyone?"

"Hmm? Oh, no. Not a single person knows. Well, except for you."

I give a half-smirk.

"I told my friends, but they all hated me afterwards. Yeah."

Oliver's smile drops slightly.

I may have killed the mood.

Great.

Oliver asks quietly, "Do you think we should tell people?"

I start feeling uneasy again.

Thankfully, Oliver is quick to notice. "W-we don't have to talk about it right now!"

I feel my whole body relax. I didn't even notice how tense I got.

"Yeah... yeah, we don't have to. Not yet."

I take Oliver's hand in mine.

"For tonight, can we stay like this? Just the two of us?"

He smiles. "Of course."

I lean back on the bench.

Today was certainly eventful.

But I'm glad the whole mystery's been solved.

I look at Oliver and think about the future ahead of us.

"Your ice cream's melting, Vinny."

Oliver licks my hand before I can react.

"Wh-- hey!"

My face goes red immediately.

Oliver does nothing but laugh.

Little brat.

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

"Oh, by the way, Vinny, we should compare powers!"

"Compare? What do you mean?"

"Like, maybe you can do something I can't!"

"Oliver, we can both read minds."

"But can you read minds underwater?"

"...What?"

I excitedly pull out my phone.

I've always wanted to share this with someone.

"I've been compiling a list of strengths and weaknesses of my ability!"

Vinny scrolls through the list in amazement and horror.

"Wow, you have too much time on your hands," he says, endearingly.

One of the entries catches his eye.

"'It works through phone calls'? What does that one mean?"

"Oh, it means you can read someone if they're calling you. They don't even have to be on the same continent!"

Vinny perks up. "Really? I gotta try that sometime."

He corrects himself right away. "Nope. No I don't. Reading people's minds is bad."

"Come on, it's a little fun, no?"

"Hmm, no."

"Killjoy," I tease.

Vinny reaches the bottom of the list.

"'Doesn't work on Vinny', huh?"

"Oh!" I yelp, sheepishly. "I guess I should update that entry now."

That's when I get a particularly devious idea.

"Although, I wonder if it only works when we kiss? What about... other kinds of contact?"

Vinny suddenly has a dangerous look in his eyes.

His voice goes one octave lower. "Wouldn't you like to know, Oliver."

I gulp.

This man is going to ruin me.

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

It's 2 AM. I feel lightheaded.

I slowly unlock the front door, trying not to disturb Jack.

Never mind, he's lying wide awake on the couch.

Jack pushes himself up. "Well, you're home early. Fun night out?"

I just nod, a mischievous grin slowly forming.

Jack raises an eyebrow before taking a quick survey of me.

"...Oh. I see."

He gives me a knowing smirk.

"Well done."

"Thank you. I'm off to bed now. Good night."

"Night. You earned it, man."

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

"Melissa! There you are!" I run over to her, frantically.

"Woah, hey, Oliver. What's up?"

"Do you have concealer?"

"...Huh?"

I put my hood down and reveal the evidence.

Her jaw drops.

"Oh my god, did you two finally--"

"Yes! Now let me ask again, do you have concealer?"

"Of course. Stop freaking out."

My face is burning with embarrassment.

"Wait until the others hear about this. Taylor's gonna have a field day."

"Eughhh..."

I hate Vinny so much right now.

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

<p class="when">3 years later</p>

"Mmph," Oliver groans.

"Get off me. I have to shower," I say, feigning annoyance.

"No. Don't wanna."

"You have class and I have work."

"We could skip both," Oliver tries to bargain.

"It's your last semester. Enjoy it while it lasts."

"Whatever, you sad corporate gremlin."

Honestly, Morning Oliver is underrated. I secretly love this side of him.

It's funny. I've seen so much of him, and yet it still feels like I know so little.

I want to know more. That's what I look forward to every day.

Through all the happy memories and the... not-so-happy ones, I'm glad I found you.

I'm glad you collided with me head-first at that soccer game.

Fate is a strange thing.

<p class="emoji">💭</p>

Oliver and I agreed to never tell anyone about our powers.

It seemed straightforward enough. We just felt it wasn't worth the trouble.

More importantly, though, we agreed to never use them again. Not even on ourselves.

It took a lot of convincing, arguing, and yelling to get there.

I used to think it'd be better if I could just forget these hurtful moments.

But I've realized they're part of who we are. Together.

Communication, between us or with others, has no shortcuts.

We both learned that the hard way, and we've changed for the better.

...

That being said, I guess there are some exceptions.

<p class="emoji">🔮</p>

I'm sat at the table, enjoying my precious pancakes.

Vinny should be leaving for work soon.

I see him walking to the door when he suddenly stops.

He has a funny look on his face.

"Vinny? What are you-- mmh!"

Vinny kisses me without warning.

<p class="thought">"Happy birthday, Ollie."</p>

Heat rushes to my cheeks.

"Gah, Vinny! You are impossible!"

"As always. See you later. I love you."

"Ugh. I love you too."
